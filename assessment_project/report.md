INTRODUCTION:
Should pull together & summmarise entire project. You may, want to pull in stats to underpin your argument as to why this project was required.

The problem I have chosen to solve is that I am having trouble tracking my fitness activity. The method I currently use to track them is physical notes, not only is it difficult to review my notes but they could be easily lost or accessed by other people making my data not very secure. In order to tackle this problem I have created a system that tracks my fitness activity. This allows me to view trends in my data, set goals to reach and it allows me to see when I have not quite met my goals or been as productive as I should have been. This system should also allow me to see why I am not being productive. I decided to do this project as fitness is something that I am very passionate about and I have tried to follow fitness plans before in order to get into shape, but I have always failed due to loss of motivation, loosing track of what exercise I have done, and mostly me losing track of where I put my notes as I have never really had a secure system to track my notes on.

Another reason that I chose to do this idea for my app is because so many people are not getting the right amount of daily exercise that the should, especially chidren and young adults. Last year it was recorded that only 67% of adults were considered active (according to government guidlines), and only 47% of children and young people were meeting the current physical activity guidlines. This is a big issue as last year the majority of adults that were admitted to hospital were obese; 67% of the men and 60% of the women, this included 26% of men and 29% of women who were actually classeed as "obese". So in order to tackle this problem I came up with the web app design where they can easily track; how much they exercise, how good their eating habits are, see when they are not meeting their goals and more. This should help ensure that adults and children are completing the reccomended amount of exercise everyday (30 minuets a day).

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
High-level overview of how system functions, can use screen shots if it helps. Should consider aspects like:
- Briefly describing all datastores including databases, file systems & media data stores.
- Key views & interfaces.
- Including a diagram of the key system components & how they are linked.

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
One of the most impotant design decisions I made when designing my app was how to set out the web app pages. I decided to set out the pages in a way that was not confusing to the user, but still looked professional. I did this by ensuring that there was not a lot happening on the page at the same time, for example with the "View Workout" page there was just the workouts displayed with a message telling the user what was happening on the page. By doing this I am ensuring that the user does not get confused by too much happening on one page at one time.

Also I have created wireframes for each of my web app pages, which I have included in the folder titled "wireframes" in my "assessment_project" folder.

DATABASE DESIGN:
This will document the different database entities & how they are related. If using a relational database may want to include an entity relationship diagram.

SECURITY AND SCALABILITY:
My database is quite secure, because in order to be able to access it(to modify it or to read the data) you need to have an admin username, and password, and I am the only one who has access to that admin account. 

CONCLUSION AND REFLECTION:
Overall this project challenged me to use everything that I have learnt on the course to create my web app. As well as everything I learnt in class it also challenged me to think outside the box about how to go about creating a web app from scratch.

Bring document to a close by tying together the process, and provide me with a brief reflective account of the entire project.
