TITLE & COVER PAGE:
Link to hosted web app.
Link to your hosted Git Repository should include:
- Professional README.md file. Should contain info on how to run the project in development & production.
- Your projects, version-controlled source files.

Here is the link to my github repository: https://github.com/CMayo64/Advanced_Database_Systems_Assignment

INTRODUCTION:
Should pull together & summmarise entire project. Should include background & inspiration that lead me to undertake this project. You may, want to pull in stats to underpin your argument as to why this project was required.

The problem I have chosen to solve is that I am having trouble tracking my fitness activity. The method I currently use to track them is physical notes, not only is it difficult to review my notes but they could be easily lost or accessed by other people making my data insecure. In order to tackle this problem I have created a system that tracks my fitness activity.It tells me what exercise I have done, at what time I did the exercise, How long I should spend on each exercise and how long I actually spent on each exercise. This allows me to view trends in my data, set goals to reach and see when I have not quite met my goals. I decided to do this project as I have tried to follow fitness plans before in order to get into shape, but I have always failed due to loss of motivation and mostly me losing track of what exercises I have done as I have never really had a way to track what I was doing and kept losing the notes I made.


SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
High-level overview of how system functions, can use screen shots if it helps. Should consider aspects like:
- Briefly describing all datastores including databases, file systems & media data stores.
- Key views & interfaces.
- Including a diagram of the key system components & how they are linked.

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
One of the key decisions I made when designing my app was to 

Should rationalise the choices you made in designing your app

DATABASE DESIGN:
This will document the different databse entities & how they are related. If using a relational database may want to include an entity relationship diagram.

SECURITY AND SCALABILITY:
Identify in what ways your app is secure & scalable.

CONCLUSION AND REFLECTION:
Bring document to a close by tying together the process, and provide me with a brief reflective account of the entire project.
