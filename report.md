TITLE & COVER PAGE:
Link to hosted web app.
Link to your hosted Git Repository should include:
- Professional README.md file. Should contain info on how to run the project in development & production.
- Your projects, version-controlled source files.

INTRODUCTION:
Should pull together & summmarise entire project. Should include background & inspiration that lead me to undertake this project. You may, want to pull in stats to underpin your argument as to why this project was required.

I have created a system that tracks my fitness activity. It tells me what exercise I have done, at what time I did the exercise, How long I should spend on each exercise and how long I actually spent on them. I decided to do this project as I have tried to follow fitness plans before in order to get into shape, but I have always failed due to loss of motivation and me losing track of what exercises I have done as I never really had a way to track what I was doing.

A system to track my fitness activity (fitness planner). I.e, What exercise i'm doing, When i'm doing it, How long I should spend on each exercise and How long I actually spent on each exercise. Decided to do this project as I have tried to do fitness plans before in ordre to get into shape, but I have always failed (lost motivation, lost track) as I never had a way to really track what I was doing when. 


SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
High-level overview of how system functions, can use screen shots if it helps. Should consider aspects like:
- Briefly describing all datastores including databases, file systems & media data stores.
- Key biews & interfaces.
- Including a diagram of the key system components & how they are linked.

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
Should rationalise the choices you made in designing your app

DATABASE DESIGN:
This will document the different databse entities & how they are related. If using a relational database may want to include an entity relationship diagram.

SECURITY AND SCALABILITY:
Identify in what ways your app is secure & scalable.

CONCLUSION AND REFLECTION:
Bring document to a close by tying together the process, and provide me with a brief reflective account of the entire project.
